# Edge Formation: Edges are not uniformly created; in-
# stead, their formation is informed by the depth of the
# relationship between nodes. Factors such as the frequency
# of co-occurrence and the strength of dependency links
# play a role in defining the edge weights, which are crucial
# for the GNN as it processes the graph to identify which
# nodes (text segments) are pivotal for the summary.
